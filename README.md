1. Cloning Your GitHub Repository
Copy the Repository URL:
Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
Click the Code button and copy the URL (HTTPS or SSH).
Clone the Repository:
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Run the following command, replacing <repository-url> with your copied URL:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository-url>
This command creates a local copy of your repository.
Navigate to the Project Directory:
bash
Copy
Edit
cd <repository-name>
2. Installing NPM Modules
Ensure Node.js and NPM are Installed:
Verify installation:
bash
Copy
Edit
node -v
npm -v
If not installed, download and install from Node.js official website.
Install Dependencies:
In project directory, run:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
This command reads the package.json file and installs all listed dependencies.
3. Running and Debugging the Project
Start the Development Server:
